				<p>The significance of the Auxerre ritual is clear in the context of medieval labyrinth lore, whereby the labyrinth sometimes symbolized hell and Theseus. The Auxerre dance, then, imitates Christ's descent into the labyrinth of Hell and his rescue of the just souls therein (the Harrowing of Hell and Resurrection). The first fully described labyrinth dance was thus a Christian ritual, an excellent example of the many kinds of dancing permitted and indeed encouraged by the medieval Christian church.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="row-start-3 col-2-to-7 mar-bot-200">
				<p>Only in the late Middle Ages can the existence of labyrinth dances performed on foot be confirmed. While labyrinth dances may have existed in any of the numerous French and Italian cathedrals containing large labyrinth mosaics in their naves, and while some evidence suggests the practice of labyrinth dances at Sens and Chartres, only at Auxerre are there extensive records (1396 and later) of an Easter labyrinth dance. At sunset, the dean and canons gathered in the nave labyrinth, where a new canon presented the dean with a pelota (“ball”). While singing Wipo's Easter sequence, Victimae paschali laudes, the dean performed a tripudium within the labyrinth as the canons danced a chorea (“carol”) around, or perhaps through, the labyrinth in a “garland-like” fashion. All the while, the pelota was thrown back and forth. Afterward the group repaired to a communal meal.</p>

					The earliest textual reference to a possible labyrinth dance is in The Iliad (eighth century BCE); it describes a ritual dance (sometimes linked with the geranos, or “crane dance”) of youths and maidens in a dancing place like that built for Ariadne by Daedalus, mythical creator of the Cretan labyrinth. The earliest visual evidence may be the Tragliatella Wine Pitcher (seventh-sixth centuries BCE), showing two mounted men and a line of nine warriors emerging from a labyrinth labeled truia. Scholars have speculated that truia may mean “dancing place,” or may refer to Troy.

					<p>Eventually, the pattern of the labyrinth began showing up in artwork and coinage of that time. The meander pattern began framing frescoes, and vases began showing up with the same wandering designs. Many coins were discovered on the Island of Crete often illustrating the famous legend of the island. Images of the labyrinth, as well as the Minotaur, were found on coins. These coins used the meander pattern to create a frame around the heads of gods, goddesses, or the rulers of Knossos.</p>

						Sir Arthur Evans had travelled to Athens in 1893 with an interest in Mycenaean art. While exploring an antique dealer’s shop, he came across a few small engraved stones, which he thought were possibly from Egypt since they had hieroglyphic symbols on them. Curious as to what they were, Evans asked the dealer where he acquired them. The dealer explained they came from Crete. These findings sparked Evans’s interest, and in the spring of 1894, he set foot in Crete for the first time. He went there with the intent to find the meaning of the stones and discovered that they were milk stones, used as charms by Cretan mothers breastfeeding their newborns. After spending some time away, Sir Arthur Evans returned to the island in 1900 and continued his research.

					<p>As enthusiasm for the crusades declined, shorter pilgrimages were substituted, usually to the shrine of some saint, such as Our Lady of Loretto, or St. Thomas of Canterbury, and it is quite possible that, at a time when the soul had passed out of the crusades and the Church's authority was on the ebb, a journey on the knees around the labyrinth's sinuosities was prescribed as an alternative to these pilgrimages. Perhaps this type of penance was from the first imposed on those who, through weakness or any other reason, were unable to undertake long travels.</p> <br><br>

					<p>Some color is lent to this supposition by the name "Chemin de Jérusalem." at Chartres. In the days of the first crusades it was a common practice for the confessor to send the peccant members of his flock either to fight against the infidel, or, after the victory of Geoffrey of Bouillon, to visit the Holy Sepulchre.</p> <br><br>

				<div class="row-start-5 col-7-to-12">
					<p>Because of the political turmoil in Palestine, it was no longer possible for European Christians to travel to Jerusalem, and as a result, many began seeking alternative ways to make this journey, even if they couldn’t physically accomplish it. The labyrinth was the solution. Suddenly these symbols became gigantic with diameters of over 10 meters, enabling the pilgrim to walk through its paths.</p> <br><br>

				<div class="row-start-6 col-6-to-11">
					<p>The earliest construction of a pavement labyrinth in France occurred between 1215 and 1221 at Chartres. The cathedral itself was begun in 1194, and Connolly argues that its construction was profoundly influenced by the then recent loss of Jerusalem to Muslim forces in 1187.</p> <br><br>
