				<p>The Minotaur in the center of the labyrinth represents the demons that Theseus must overcome or the questions for which he must find answers. Once he wrestled with his demons, he then retraced his steps and emerged with a new understanding of life. In his book <I>Ritual: Psycho-Analytic Studies</i>, Theodor Reik looked at the aboriginal peoples of Australia. In their culture, the youths are put through a test prior to their initiation into adult society. A monster, represented by a gluttonous creature who demands young people to satisfy its cravings, symbolically kills them. This Australian ritual is similar to what the tributes from Athens were subjected, a monstrous creature that had an appetite for children. According to psychoanalytical theory, when children feel threatened by anxiety or fear, the ego kicks in and enters into a struggle for survival in which the child brings out all the available methods of defense. The result, according to Anna Freud, is that the personality changes. The adolescent’s ego can acknowledge its new form of maturity, and the child accepts himself/herself as an adult.</p>

						<p class="hidden-def mono-def">The noun <b>clue</b> appeared as a variant spelling of <b>clew</b>, of the same pronunciation. Not frequent until the 17th century, <b>clue</b> has become the prevailing form of the work in the sense of a fact or idea that serves to reveal something or solve a problem. Both the forms <b>clew</b> and <b>clue</b> were especially used to refer to the ball of thread employed as the means of ‘threading’ a way through a labyrinth or maze in various mythological or legendary narratives, the best-known being that of Theseus.</p>

				In Greek myth, Ariadne helped Theseus escape the labyrinth of the Minotaur. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;overcome in the soul’s movement toward salvation. The serpent shape, often found on prehistoric rock drawings, is most directly related to pathways and the promise of freedom or release at the end of the journey. The spiral labyrinth illustrates two basic movements, inward and outward. It can be associated with life processes of ingestion and energy. The spiral is also a powerful archetype that represents time, the cycle of the seasons, and the arc of life.

					<p class="mar-bot-200">Some writers have held that the labyrinth was inserted in the church as typifying the Christian's life or the devious course of those who yield to temptation. Some have thought that it represented the path from the house of Pilate to Calvary, pointing out that Chateaubriand, in his "Itinéraire de Paris à Jérusalem," mentioned two hours as the period which he took to repeat Christ's journey, and that the same time would be taken in traversing the average pavement labyrinth on the knees. The use of the labyrinth as a simile for the Christian's life is <span class="green-underline-copy">shown in a stone inscription in the Museum at Lyons</span>. Whether this inscription was ever attached to a labyrinthine design is not known.</p>

					<p>In the symbolic cross labyrinth, the vertical axis links the underworld to heaven. As with the cross in traditional Christian iconography, in the labyrinth the cross “reconciles opposed directions and divided drives at its center” (de Freitas 1987: 417). The Christian maze, found primarily in naves of French and Italian medieval churches, was approached and entered from the west. The penitent moves eastward, and the symbolism is potent – east is the dawning of the day, the spiritual rebirth in the faith (Wright 2001: 19). Typically, the Christian labyrinth contains eleven tracks within its circumference, symbolizing “sin, dissonance, transition, and incompleteness” (Wright 2001: 23). “It extends beyond the number of the Commandments,” writes Wright, “yet does not attain that of the Apostles or of the months of the year” (2001: 23). The center rosette is often construed to be a symbol of the Virgin Mary, writes Lauren Artress (1995: 58).</p>
