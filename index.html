				<h3>The Labyrinth is famously known for its association with the Greek myth which goes as follows:</h3>
				Once upon a time, the sea god Poseidon sent a white bull to the court of Minos at Knossos in Crete for ritual slaughter. <button type="button">Minos</button>
				<div class="hidden">
					<div>
						<p class="hidden-def mono-def">Minos was one of the three sons from the union of Europa and Zeus; when Zeus was took the form of a bull. Europa's husband was the King of Crete, Asterion, who looked over the boys as if they were his own. When Aseterion died, it was unclear which of the three sons should ascend to power. The three sons were Minos, Sarpedon, and Rhadamanthus. It was Minos, whose name in Cretan actually means king, who was fated to be king of Crete even though Minos' ascension to power was a difficult journey because he first had to see off his sibling rivals.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				declined to kill the animal and in revenge Poseidon engendered in Pasiphae, the queen of Minos, an uncontrollable lust for the bull. The outcome of her sexual gratification was none other than the Minotaur. The ever-ingenious Minos hired the architect Daedalus to construct a space in which to house the savage beast.
				<br><br>

				<p>While the construction of the Labyrinth was underway, King Minos discovered that his only human son with Pasiphae, Androgeos, had been killed. <a href="page2.html" class="inline-link-next" id="highlight-link">Minos blamed the Athenians</a> for the destruction of his family line. He sailed against the Athenians and harassed them until they agreed to pay the price for his son's death. Minos demanded that Athens pay a tribute to Crete of seven maidens and seven youths every nine years. (There is some contradiction in the sources about how often these tribute were made, from every nine years to once a year). These tributes would then be placed in the Labyrinth for the Minotaur to devour. Reluctantly, the Athenians submitted to Minos' terms and King Minos returned to Crete.</p>

			<div class="col2">
				<p>Theseus was said to have volunteered for the third <span class="boustrophedon">tribute of youths. Death now turns to a love story. He</span> discovered to his felicitous surprise that Ariadne, one <span class="boustrophedon">of the Kingâ€™s daughters, had fallen in love with him.</span> She supplied Theseus with a thread of gold by which <span class="boustrophedon">he could retrace his course through the winding</span> structure. Brave Theseus entered the labyrinth, slayed <span class="boustrophedon">the Minotaur, retraced his steps back along the thread,</span> set the palace on fire and escaped with Ariadne to <span class="boustrophedon">Naxos where he deserted her. The rest is architecture</span> and speculation.</p>
