				<h3>Ancient writers from Roman times argued that the Labyrinth was a set of winding caves they knew were located on the south side of Crete at Gortyna. In the early 19th century C.R. Cockerell visited these caves and wrote in his journal that he and his party entered the cavern through an inconspicuous hole in the hillside of Mount Ida and unwound a length of twine to keep from getting lost.</h3>

				<p class="mono-text">Gortyn, also spelled Gortyna, ancient Greek city toward the western end of the southern plain (Mesara) of Crete (near modern Áyioi Dhéka). Although unimportant in Minoan times, Gortyn displaced Phaestus as the dominant city in the Mesara. It shared or disputed control of the island with Knossos until the Roman annexation in 67 BCE. Its importance lay in its control of the sea route between east and west through its ports of Matalon and Leben.</p>

						<p class="hidden-def mono-def">Cristoforo Buondelmonti (c. 1385-c. 1430) was a Florentine monk and geographer. In 1406 Buondelmonti settled in Rhodes and stayed on the island for eight years. He learned Greek, and in the following six years travelled to Istanbul, the Aegean islands and Cyprus. Buondelmonti gradually composed the first isolario, that is, a collection of island maps accompanied by historical and geographical texts. Thanks to Buondelmonti's pioneering work, which constituted a model for later isolaria, the Greek islands became known to scholars and geographers.</p>

				in 1415. In his work, Description of the Island of Crete, he identifies the caves at Gortyn as the site of the labyrinth. Other visitors to Gortyn include William Lithgow in 1610, and in 1680 the English traveller Bernard Randolph, who remained in the Labyrinth for one hour. He advanced less than 100 meters, which was the length of the yarn he used to keep from getting lost—no doubt inspired by his mythical predecessor Theseus. His description of the cave is rather vague, but he does mention encountering a large number of bats. <br><br>

				The belief that Gortyn was the mythical labyrinth of Minos was particularly promoted by the Venetian governors of the island, who sought to have the “real” labyrinth in their territory, and they regularly organised journeys to the “Gortyn Labyrinth” for important visitors from Venice. But the idea of the Gortyn Labyrinth didn’t last—by the 18th century, most travellers agreed that it was in fact a Roman quarry. However, even prior to the 18th century, there had been dissenting voices regarding the location of the labyrinth at Gortyn. In 1435 a Spanish traveller called Pero Tafur produced a short description in which he put the Labyrinth at Knossos, “wuth many other antiquities.” Other travellers agreed. In 1745, Richard Pococke favoured “an eminence to the south” of the Roman ruins at Knossos—the Kefala Hill, the location of the Bronze Age palace.

				<h3>The caves at Gortyn, as much as they might seem to fit the legend are in the wrong place as the Labyrinth was supposedly located at Knossos. Some writers have speculated that another similar set of caves, now lost, near Knossos served as the Labyrinth, but modern archaeologists have come to another conclusion.</h3>

				Archaeologists have found no evidence that a horrible half-man, half-bull-like creature existed at Knossos. However, they have found what looks like a labyrinth. The labyrinth wasn't built in a cave below the palace, though. It was the palace. While archaeologists are unsure of who lived in the Knossos palace, they have uncovered a quantity of ceremonial and religious imagery there. This leads some to believe that the chief occupant of the building was a 'priest-king' who had the dual function of leading the state and the religion.<br><br>

				The chronology of the palace is a matter of scholarly debate. Construction of the palace appears to have begun around 1950 BCE, although there may have been structures predating it. This "first palace" (as it is sometimes called) was damaged (likely by earthquakes) around 1700 BCE and a second palace was built on top of it.<br><br>

				The first excavation at the site of Knossos took place in 1878, under the directorship of the appropriately named Minos Kalokairinos, a local Cretan merchant. He dug 12 trial trenches into the hill, and was constantly coming upon the massive walls of an extensive building, as well as excavating <button type="button">pithoi</button>.

				However, local authorities prevented any further digging, fearing the Ottoman rulers of Crete (who had taken over the island from the Venetians in 1669) would move any artifacts found to Istanbul.

				It was the American journalist W. J. Stillman, a former American consul in Crete, who in the 19th century re-introduced the notion that Knossos might be the Labyrinth of Greek mythology. His articles&mdash;in which he referred to the &ldquo;Daedalian labyrinth&rdquo;&mdash;were widely read and even inspired Heinrich Schliemann (the excavator of Troy and Mycenae) to venture to Crete and dig at Knossos. However, with a new political regime in place, his attempts were denied.<br><br>

				Unlike Schliemann, Sir Arthur Evans was permitted to explore the palace ruins. Almost immediately, he began discovering the ruins of a building sprawling over many acres, with twists and turns in every direction he looked. Proclaiming success, Evans claimed that he had unearthed the palace of King Minos and its labyrinth. Further, he came up with the idea to name the island’s ancient civilization the Minoans, after the legendary King Minos whom he believed had built the citadel.<br><br>

				Evans’s work at Knossos aroused widespread public interest, kindled in April 1900 by his cable to the London Times and detailed in a series of succeeding articles. In a Times article of August 10th 1990, Evans took for granted the historicity of Minos, “the great law-giver” who “promulgated his famous institutions and…established a maritime empire…Here Daedalus constructed the Labyrinth, the den of the Minotaur, and fashioned the wings—perhaps the sails—with which he and Icarus took flight over the Aegean.” The level of media coverage achieved by Evans in his own time can be gauged even as early as the 4th July 1901, when Sigmund Freud wrote in one of his letters:<br><br>
