					<h3>Labyrinths have been known to the human race for well over 4000 years. They seem to have emerged and re-emerged, capturing our interest in several time waves and in slightly differing forms throughout this period.</h3>

					<p>There is evidence of the existence of the classical labyrinth symbol (the most ancient labyrinth pattern) across southern Europe and North Africa from roughly 2000 BCE. Over time it took the form of rock carvings and paintings, inscriptions on ceramics, tiles and coins. The same basic design began to appear across Asia, the Americas and Southern Africa in an assortment of forms including rock carvings, sand games, wall paintings, wooden sculptures and woven baskets. Somewhere between circa 165 BCE to 400 CE the classical design morphed into that of the more complex Roman one. The Roman labyrinths were mainly mosaic pavement labyrinths laid in the floors of bathhouses, villas and tombs throughout the Roman Empire. Virtually all such mosaics were too small for walking.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Towards the end of the 9th century a monk called Otfrid took the classical seven circuit labyrinth pattern and added four extra circuits creating the more complex eleven circuit labyrinth design we know today as the medieval labyrinth. His drawing in the endpaper of his Book of Gospels became a precedent for the construction of dozens of 12th-13th century labyrinths found in cathedrals and churches across Europe. As time went on, breaks or turns in the walls at north, south, east and west points were added to the pattern. The most famous of these, the Chartres Labyrinth laid down in circa 1201, is still intact in the floor of the nave of Chartres Cathedral, France. The later classical and medieval stone or turf labyrinths of Northern Europe, largely laid down between the 12th and 17th centuries, were also walking labyrinths.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Although some claim that the idea and the notion of a labyrinth are &ldquo;only&rdquo; four to five thousand years old, it is more likely that it has been following humankind much longer than that. However, as things usually happen, the further we go into the past, the evidence is more unclear, and interpretations can take on different forms. For instance, the Neolithic origin of labyrinths is not questionable. Namely, the Neolithic was a time full of secrets. It was a time when astronomy and astrology developed, together with the measurement of time and cosmic rhythms. Furthermore, many things originated in Neolithic&mdash;understanding of life and death, ideas on reincarnation, as well as other spiritual and even technical knowledge (megaliths, building astronomical observatories and similar). It is questionable whether the labyrinth as a structure existed even earlier, in the Palaeolithic, more than twelve thousand years ago.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Forms similar to labyrinths have been found in most of the old cultures on all continents: Celtic, Mayan, Greek, Cretan, American-Indian, Indian&#8230;Of course, the interpretation as to the universality of the appearance of labyrinths is different. If it was indeed created in a single place, its most probable point of birth is the Mediterranean circle and the culture of Old Europe. However, if this is true and that is the place from which the labyrinth spread across the world, it does not mean that the idea could not have existed, in this or some other form, in other Neolithic cultures of that era.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Their Neolithic origin connects them with the megalithic structures&mdash;big stone blocks that Neolithic people, in a mysterious and unexplained way, put up in specific places. If nothing else, they were probably present at the same time. The megaliths have survived, at least partially, because they are enormous. They remained among us as a forgotten giant reminder of their unknown past. On the other hand, the labyrinths survived in the collective consciousness of humankind with much less material evidence.</p>
