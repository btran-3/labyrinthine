				<p>Although some claim that the idea and the notion of a labyrinth are “only” four to five thousand years old, it is more likely that it has been following humankind much longer than that. However, as things usually happen, the further we go into the past, the evidence is more unclear, and interpretations can take on different forms. For instance, the Neolithic origin of labyrinths is not questionable. Namely, the Neolithic was a time full of secrets. It was a time when astronomy and astrology developed, together with the measurement of time and cosmic rhythms. Furthermore, many things originated in Neolithic—understanding of life and death, ideas on reincarnation, as well as other spiritual and even technical knowledge (megaliths, building astronomical observatories and similar). It is questionable whether the labyrinth as a structure existed even earlier, in the Palaeolithic, more than twelve thousand years ago.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Forms similar to labyrinths have been found in most of the old cultures on all continents: Celtic, Mayan, Greek, Cretan, American-Indian, Indian…Of course, the interpretation as to the universality of the appearance of labyrinths is different. If it was indeed created in a single place, its most probable point of birth is the Mediterranean circle and the culture of Old Europe. However, if this is true and that is the place from which the labyrinth spread across the world, it does not mean that the idea could not have existed, in this or some other form, in other Neolithic cultures of that era.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Their Neolithic origin connects them with the megalithic structures – big stone blocks that Neolithic people, in a mysterious and unexplained way, put up in specific places. If nothing else, they were probably present at the same time. The megaliths have survived, at least partially, because they are enormous. They remained among us as a forgotten giant reminder of their unknown past. On the other hand, the labyrinths survived in the collective consciousness of humankind with much less material evidence.</p>
