				The Mahabharata is an ancient Indian epic where the main story revolves around two branches of a family—the Pandavas and Kauravas—who, in the Kurukshetra War, battle for the throne of Hastinapura. At 100,000 verses, it is the longest epic poem ever written, generally thought to have been composed in the 4th century BCE or earlier. Armies used a scale of measure known as <button type="button">Akshauhini</button>

				<h1>Basilica of Reparata</h1>

				Labyrinths were a pagan idea, inextricably linked to gods and monsters, until around CE 324. In this year the basilica of Reparata was founded in north Africa. The floor mosaic, Roman in style yet Christian in substance, was a practical hybrid and is the first known church labyrinth. The medium was as important as the message, and a familiar medium was more effective in housing the unfamiliar. So, here we have four quadrants and even the thread of Ariadne, but it does not lead to the old scenario of man over monster; rather, it leads to the new heart of the matter: Sancta Ecclesia (the Holy Church). <br> <br>

				Looking at the labyrinth of St. Reparata, one will notice that it is unlike its successors in Medieval Europe. While later labyrinths would follow the Cretan model, Saint Reparata is unmistakably Roman, meaning it is square and was originally laid down in 324 CE, making St. Reparata the earliest known church labyrinth in the world. Unique to this object, the labyrinth’s center seems to be comprised of a crossword puzzle, but this is actually a palindrome of “Sancta Ecclesia.” This means that no matter how one reads this phrase, be it forwards or backwards, vertically or horizontally, it will always say the same thing. As a result, this creates a “process of reversal” in which the mirroring phrases reflect a higher, spiritual, truth. With the phrase Sancta Ecclesia, or Holy Church, replacing the figures of Theseus and the Minotaur, this early Christian labyrinth is an assertion that while the journey to the center is perilous, the reward for reaching it is not death as in the Greek legend, but eternal life.

				The full flowering of the medieval labyrinth design came about during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries with the grand pavement labyrinths of the gothic cathedrals, most notably Chartres and Amiens in France. <br><br>
				The Chartres Labyrinth is a Christian classic. Its design has formed the basis for European ecclesiastical labyrinths since CE 1200, and it is still a blueprint in the ongoing labyrinth revival. A rosette at its heart is surrounded by 11 rings and a unicursal path. The almost-true circle is divided into four, its center the meeting of a cruciform that was referred to as Jerusalem. Cathedrals were a focus for pilgrimage in the Middle Ages, and a perfectly respectable substitute for Jerusalem itself. It is generally thought that at the end of the pilgrimage a more concise journey was required, around the labyrinth, preferably on the knees.<br><br>
				Names for cathedral labyrinths were varied, and that at Chartres was known as the Chemin de Jérusalem (‘path to Jerusalem’). ‘Home of Daedalus’ (domi Daedali) was also used here from the earliest days, and that takes us to a curious fact: the center of this Christian floor design contains an image of the Minotaur. Despite the outrageously bad example set by Greek and Roman gods, pagan imagery was useful in disseminating Christian ideas, and so it was not scorned by the early Catholic Church.
