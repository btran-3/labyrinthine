				The Mahabharata is an ancient Indian epic where the main story revolves around two branches of a family—the Pandavas and Kauravas—who, in the Kurukshetra War, battle for the throne of Hastinapura. At 100,000 verses, it is the longest epic poem ever written, generally thought to have been composed in the 4th century BCE or earlier. Armies used a scale of measure known as <button type="button">Akshauhini</button>
				<div class="hidden">
					<div>
						<p class="hidden-def mono-def">A single Akshauhini consisted of 21,870 chariots, 21,870 elephants, 65,610 cavalry and 109,350 infantry.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				to measure strength. Iit is said that over the course of the war, 18-20 Akshauhini armies were killed. There were enough men to spare for a formation like the <button type="button">Chakravyuha.</button>
				<div class="hidden">
					<div>
						<p class="hidden-def mono-def">The formation was designed as a spinning wheel (hence the “chakra” in the name) and a puzzle (hence the “vyuh”), with the formation in a constant state of rotation. It was designed by Drona, one of the smartest tacticians on the side of the Kauravas.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<br><br>

				<p>There were seven layers, with the innermost layer consisting of the strongest soldiers. Soldiers of the</p>
				<p class="infinite-scroll"><span>inner level were technically and physically stronger</span></p>
				<p class="infinite-scroll infinite-scroll2"><span>inner level were technically and physically stronger</span></p>
				<p class="infinite-scroll infinite-scroll3"><span>inner level were technically and physically stronger</span></p>
				<br>than the soldiers of the immediate outer level. Infantry formed the outer layers of Chakravyuh and the inner layers were formed by armored chariots and elephant cavalry. At the center of Chakravyuh were the best of warriors awaiting to kill the invading warrior. Weak and strong warriors were strategically placed in each of the layers, either to inflict maximum damage to the opposing warriors or to defend attacks from skilled warriors of the enemy.

				The Chakravyuh was essentially a juggernaut. The whole formation continuously spun across the battlefield, continuously fighting. The moment one member of the formation was killed, there was a sliding motion that propagated from the position held by the killed man, right up to the center of the formation, thus ensuring that at all times there existed a continuous maze. The Chakravyuh resembles the fatal formation that requires skills of the highest order to survive as many warriors easily forget the ethics of war in such a cruel formation.

Although unimportant in Minoan times, Gortyn displaced Phaestus as the dominant city in the Mesara. It shared or disputed control of the island with Knossos until the Roman annexation in 67 BCE. Its importance lay in its control of the sea route between east and west through its ports of Matalon and Leben.</p>

				The belief that Gortyn was the mythical labyrinth of Minos was particularly promoted by the Venetian governors of the island, who sought to have the “real” labyrinth in their territory, and they regularly organised journeys to the “Gortyn Labyrinth” for important visitors from Venice. But the idea of the Gortyn Labyrinth didn’t last—by the 18th century, most travellers agreed that it was in fact a Roman quarry. However, even prior to the 18th century, there had been dissenting voices regarding the location of the labyrinth at Gortyn. In 1435 a Spanish traveller called Pero Tafur produced a short description in which he put the Labyrinth at Knossos, “wuth many other antiquities.” Other travellers agreed. In 1745, Richard Pococke favoured “an eminence to the south” of the Roman ruins at Knossos—the Kefala Hill, the location of the Bronze Age palace.
